# Portfolio
This is my work. I have taken time to author these apps, tools, sites and extentions with love. This is a story of the work that went into them.

## Circuit App
-- Laravel, Blade, Tailwind CSS, Alpine JS, PHP, (Livewire, FilamentPHP)
This is an in house project managment admin panel that aims to simplify the managment of multiple projects with a pipeline. It helps to delegate the work and keep the developer assets close together.

## TruePay IBEW
-- HTML, JS, CSS, Chrome Browser API
This was a small Chrome extension meant to help skilled trade workers in a local trade union to make infromed decisions when choosing among open jobs. This is accomplished by gathering pay information from the page and then computing taxes, travel, per-diem, accomadations and food in order to give a good estimate of how profitable a job will be.

## ACFLS App
-- Laravel, Blade, Tailwind CSS, Alpine JS, PHP
This is an admin panel for an app which is intended to keep track of professional training and continuning education for an association of family lawyers.
